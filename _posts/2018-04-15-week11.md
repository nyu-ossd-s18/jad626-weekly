# Qutebrowser Progress

This week we've mostly still been looking at the issue regarding adding favicons, which has turned out to be harder than we expected. We have tried several approaches, and after striking out one which definitely didn't work, as well as trying out the suggested approach (which we tried several times to no avail), and even coming up with a really lazy approach which also broke the app, before going back to the second approach.

As a result, and as a way to try to stick to our goals, I instead decided to look into our second issue, which is a feature request which would allow a user to query multiple search engines. This has also been really difficult, since it first required parsing through several code files in order to find out how the searches work, as well as the dependencies, and then I had to try to write code which would build off that to open several windows simultaneously. It also begged the question of whether that file was the right file in which to put this feature. In short, it's still a work in progress!
