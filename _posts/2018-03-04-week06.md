# Team Assessment + Open Data Week Plans

### Team Strengths - Bitcoin

Going off my teammates' assessment of their skills on their blogs, I think we have a very varied yet complementary array of strengths. For example, we have people familiar with the Linux environment, which could be very useful for testing, considering some of us work on MacOS. Some are more experienced with Github and making contributions, but aren't too big on documentation, while I enjoy documentation/checking for less technical issues.

### Meeting Time:

\*Monday 5PM works for the group.

### Challenges:

This is an ambitious project that we aren't all really familiar with, so it will be challenging to take on the learning curve. However, I think this'll be rewarding as well.

\*In class, Joanna emphasized the difficulty of the project / the issue that it might not be newcomer-friendly for various reasons. As a result, we'll have to make a decision about whether we should/want to continue with it.

### Milestones

I would love to address a significant (defined as something substantial that won't be dismissed) issue or find one myself and be able to contribute that way. For a lot of the projects we've explored, it's been so hard to even find where to start.


### Open Data Week Events:

  The events I plan to attend are:

  [Data through Design: Art Exhibit](http://www.open-data.nyc/#details256)      
  (Really excited about this, actually, as a lover of art/art history and look forward to see the intersectionality of art and open data.)


  ~~[HUMAN DATA: The Impact of Open Data for Connected Infrastructure](http://www.open-data.nyc/#details190)       
  (Mostly going to this because it's close (in Greenpoint) and I think A/D/O is a fun venue, but also interested to see how physical and virtual infrastructure interact.)~~

  \*[FUTURE City Lab Curator-Led Group Tour](http://www.open-data.nyc/#details119) - Similar to the first exhibit; love checking out aesthetic representations of data. Also love history and as a NYC native, interesting to see what the data-based predictions of the future are.
