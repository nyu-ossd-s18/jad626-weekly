## OPEN SOURCE:
When I hear the term "open source," immediately, the usual buzzwords come to mind: it's freely available to the public, and easy to modify and redistribute. Beyond that, though, open-source is being able to put the user in the front seat, by furnishing them with the ability to know the inner workings and nuances of the software (and even allowing them to implement changes as they see fit). In addition, there's the incredibly valuable aspect of community——of connecting to people with whom you share a common goal, and helping one another through the exchange of knowledge.

The rise of open-source is in part due to its various advantages compared to close-source. Again, given that the user (ideally) has access to the source code, it allows a starting platform from which the user can build. It's not uncommon for people to have similar project ideas. By giving people a medium to build upon that platform, they can get a head start in crafting something they want to create, and contribute changes that others may find helpful or alluring. It's also a great way for beginners to learn about how to produce cleaner code, and provides them an interactive group of people who are willing to provide feedback and advice (which is facilitated through the common code). A potential issue with open source could be that if a project attracts too many contributors, it may be difficult to make as much progress as you would otherwise. If there's an overwhelming number of contributions that need to be looked at, discussed, and approved, and if there are people with differing goals, then these factors may stymie the advancement of the project.

## PROJECTS:
[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/):Firefox is my go-to browser. I've even started using it on my iPhone (it has a QR code reader and a night mode setting built in, which can come in handy). With the latest Firefox Quantum release, I find it to be the sleekest, fastest browser, and it uses much less memory than Google Chrome (where each tab is run as its own process). It also has a myriad of extensions, while maintaining a degree of minimalism. I also appreciate the Firefox team's commitment to privacy, which has been a subject of much debate recently, and which Google in particular has been in the hot seat about. Of course, other helpful and popular alternatives are Safari and Chrome.

[Atom](https://atom.io/): Atom is an easy-to-use, customizable text editor that I discovered when browsing Github's Student Developer Pack. It is much more fun and aesthetically pleasing than MacOS's built-in TextEdit editor, and although more complex than Sublime (a favorite for many), the available plug-ins are often useful and fun. I use this editor when opening files and when trying to abstain from using the helpful shortcuts that IDEs like JetBrains' IntelliJ and Eclipse provide. Also, my favorite plug-in is "Activate Power Mode," which comes in handy when I need to write code but am unmotivated, as it makes it almost into a game. It also comes with a combo mode that keeps track of the continuous keystrokes/changes you've made. Here's a demo:

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): Homebrew is a "missing package manager" that, as they say on their website, "
installs the stuff you need that Apple didn’t." It simplifies the downloading and installation of several libraries and software packages, which are often in turn used by other larger software projects. When installing other projects on my computer through the Terminal, I've found that Homebrew is often a suggested resource. Some alternatives (which admittedly I haven't checked out myself) are Rudix and Conda.

[VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html): Every time I get a new computer, this is one of the first products I download. VLC Media Player is, in my opinion,unrivaled by any similar software. I prefer it without a doubt to Apple's native QuickTime Player and--back when I used Windows-- Windows Media Player. It is able to play a greater range of files (some of which are often obscure and newer technology not supported by other players), and allows the user to add subtitles to a video manually, which is extremely useful.

## QUESTIONS FOR TOM:
How has RedHat's open source nature affected (for better or worse) the development of software/the company's growth?

In your experience, does the work culture of an open source company vary from the cultures of closed source companies?
