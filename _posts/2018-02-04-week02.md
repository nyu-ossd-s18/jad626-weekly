# The Cathedral and the Bazaar

The cathedral and bazaar styles of software development are starkly different but each have numerous advantages. The cathedral style is the traditional style of development: a select, specialized few work on software tools independently from the users. There are no beta versions interwoven among stable releases, at which point the public is finally able to interact with the result or the code involved.

The bazaar style is more bustling and interactive. It follows the "release early, release often" principle that goes against the cathedral methodology: it's beneficial to have contributing developers interacting with the code the whole way through—especially when they can serve as useful beta testers. It emphasizes "Linus's Law": "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow." In other words, the more people who are involved in the development of a project, the more likely it is that there will be someone who can identify an issue someone (likely someone different from the identifier, with a different set of skills) can fix with their development toolkit. This style highly places importance on involving, depending on, and ultimately listening to the users/contributors.

What's interesting to me about the bazaar style of software development is that, according to Eric Raymond, "one cannot code from the ground up in bazaar style." A key component (and maybe even an advantage) to the bazaar style is that there needs to be something to build upon—someone needs to originate the project à la Cathedral; it is later that interested developers go about testing, debugging, reworking, and even taking over the project.
