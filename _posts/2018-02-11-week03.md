# On Making a Wiki Contribution

One of the Wikimedia Foundation's most admirable features is its availability in multiple languages. If you are reading a Wiki article about something that's the product of another country (i.e., culture, geography, language, etc.), it's very likely that there's a corresponding Wiki article in the language(s) of that country. Being multilingual, I find this really useful whenever I want to find more information that's lacking in English (or another language I'm browsing in). 

Unfortunately, sometimes the information in one language is extremely scarce / limited, and the article's quality could greatly improve if it had a translation of the info in another. For this reason, I found the [Category:Articles needing translation from foreign-language Wikipedias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_translation_from_foreign-language_Wikipedias) page. I first clicked on the Spanish culture page and picked a random article: the page for [No me pidan que sonr√≠a](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_me_pidan_que_sonr%C3%ADa), a Venezuelan novel. Initially the article only had two short sentences, so I went to the Spanish article and translated it, and made it more aesthetically pleasing by adding a plot section. As anyone who speaks more than one language can imagine, translating it was harder than I initially expected, especially because Wiki articles for the most part have a certain degree of quality / language used. The article in Spanish was also not written well and I found myself having to omit several poor language choices / irrelevant or biased things. Also, there are attribution rules in place, and I had to add to the Talk page. Here's the before and after:

After doing that, I went to the French equivalent and added to the Wiki article for [Bibigon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibigon), a defunct Russian children's TV channel, using info from the French page. I polished the language already in the article, added some info, and added a section detailing the programs that aired on it.
