# NYC Open Data Week

### Data through Design Art Exhibit:
This event seemed to be popular among my classmates (to be fair, it was the most accessible, running every day of the week). Frankly, that––and the exhibit's location in DUMBO––were pretty much the only things I really enjoyed. It turned out to be a lot smaller than what I was expecting (I actually missed it when I first walked in!). The exhibit consisted of several visual representations of data vis-à-vis New York City's. I think the most *creative* data representation was the "Broken Windows and Pink Tickets," (which I took a selfie in front of, given that the actual Data through Design poster was half my height...but the photo to the left of the selfie in the collage is of this project) where types of ticketable offenses (e.g., turnstile hopping, spitting, trespassing) were represented by cords, and their frequencies by the lengths of the cords. I also thought the representation of car accidents in the city (2nd on the bottom row) was really interesting/aesthetically pleasing. The gif shows a visualization of sexual violence in NYC in 2016. The LED lights change in real time to reflect the time sexual offenses were committed. This one was especially jarring, I think. Unfortunately, the exhibit was something that you could get through in five minutes, but I did enjoy seeing the intersection of data and art. I saw how useful it is to see the city's open data in a more aesthetically pleasing/easier-to-process view, which can also be educational (for example, the top right photo (yes, of a dog's head on a man body) shows how data can be misrepresented or misinterpreted with valid data––I think this was the one with the biggest take-away: data is incredible useful, but take the time to process it accurately!).

### Future City Lab Tour:

This event/exhibit was more what I was looking forward to. I love art and museums so this one was a no-brainer. This event was led by the director, the super charming Kubi Ackerman. As a native New Yorker who will be leaving the city to relocate for work in a couple of months, this exhibit was especially enticing for me. The exhibit, held in the Museum of the City of New York in Spanish Harlem, was dedicated to using data in order to make substantial predictions about the future of New York City, particularly by 2050. It addressed five critical problems that we should seek to resolve, such as providing sufficient transportation and keeping the city green. Ackerman is visually passionate about this project, and in my opinion, did a great job of coordinating pieces that paint a fascinating picture of both the current as well as future status of NYC. We were encouraged to write responses to thought-provoking "what-if" questions (such as "What if the city had no incentives to build affordable housing?") on bright cards that we then left on a display table––or alternatively to ask our own "what-if" questions––as well as to make our own attempts to solve issues by creating improvements on the interactive challenge tables, which let you create buildings, greenery, etc. and remodel neighborhoods according to your vision. My favorite part can be seen in the gif provided: you can visualize/bring these changes to life on the Creation Wall, which was super cool. I think this exhibit does a great job of showing how much we can benefit from the city's open data in order to learn about the past and know about the current status of things, but also––just as importantly––to predict future trends and attempt to plan around that.
